# RoarExchange

This is our Roar Exchange app. 

The current model is a campus-specific platform catering to Columbia University students, particularly FGLI students. The platform focuses on safety, affordability, and convenience by enabling students to buy, sell, and offer services. It includes key features like a homepage for browsing items, product/service details pages for informed decisions, and integrated ratings and feedback systems to build trust among users. The design aims to balance functionality with simplicity, ensuring an intuitive user experience.

The code includes both frontend and backend implementations to ensure a seamless user experience. The frontend, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporates key features such as the homepage, reviews screen, and listing screen, reflecting the latest design updates. The backend in Flask enables core functionalities like uploading a product or service, ensuring smooth integration and operation of these features. Together, these components were designed to provide a functional, user-friendly interface while maintaining reliability and efficiency in handling user interactions.

To run, start the backend by running app.py. 
Once that is running, head to the frontend/my-app and run npm start to start the browser. 
Here, you will see the running project where you can test functionalities.
